# Safer Infrastructure and Construction

Civil infrastructure such as buildings, dams, bridges, tunnels, rail tracks, needs to be monitored and controlled to ensure there are not movements that can affect their integrity. This is especially critical when there is a construction or earthworks works nearby.

The control is made analyzing the data of engineered sensors and devices that measure physical parameters such as inclination, settlement, cracks, deformation, etc.

Traditionally this data has been collected manually by hand-written forms, datasheets or with automatic cable-based SCADA systems, what is challenging in a rough and continuously changing environment, with hard and risky places to access.

The new Internet of Things (IoT) technologies allow to have autonomous dataloggers that can collect low frequent data, without the need of cellular connection and batteries lasting for years. Moreover, new industrial-grade Edge Computers also allow plug and play connectivity, control and simple maintenance for the high powered, high frequency equipment.

Both technologies, combined with Cloud computing platforms, allow those streams of data can be properly collected, managed, visualized and analyzed in real-time, anywhere, by different users in a secure environment, with no datafiles involved, database corruption or complex set-ups.

Moreover, the great availability of personal cell phones, enable to have a digitalization tool right on the hand, uploading data, photos through forms as soon as cellular connectivity is available.

tailored:systems offers a range of innovative solutions to digitalize and automatize the data collection, processing and visualization

## Typical Data to process

- Positon from Total Stations and GPS
- Water pressure from Piezometers,
- Inclination and movement from Tiltmeters
- Deformation from Strain Gauges, Crackmeters, Extensometers
- Slope stability from In-place inclinometers and SAA
- Temperature and Humidity from PT100
- Vibration from Accelerometers and Geo-phones
- Location coordinates of the assets

## Solution Arquitecture

### Ackcio

Ackcio self-healing WiSUN mesh network offers a range of kilometers between nodes and Gateways, with a battery life of years. Their range of dataloggers allows plenty of flexibility in connecting many different industrial interfaces like Vibrating Wire VW, 4.20mA, Voltage, Titlmeter, Digital or even the always complex SAA.

With an outdoor Gateway, that works standalone (no need of proprietary Cloud), you can build any kind of Geotechnical application.

### milesight

Milesight is a manufacturer of IoT connectivity devices based on LoRaWAN and Cellular. Their range of products allows plenty of flexibility in connecting many different industrial interfaces like 4.20mA, Modbus, RS232, RS485 or GPIOs.

Morevoer, they provide a simple and economic range of LoRa sensors for the most common applications like Temperature (PT100), Humidity, CO2, TVOC, water level or soil moisture.

### iotailor

IoTailor is a cloud data management tool with plenty of capabilities. It can store temetry and metadata efficiently, make customs dashboards, alerts by SMS or email, reports.

We has developed connection and integration paths for the majority of industrial sensors out in the market, via API or FTP.

### sensemetrics

Connecting a geotechnical sensor has never been so easy. Add a device on the sensemetrics cloud platform and start to see relevant and actionable graphs right away.

The Thread is an edge-computer that can control, command and data-log from complex digital devices such as AMTS, SAA or meteorological stations, as well as concentrate and read the great variety of Vibrating Wire and Analog sensors. .

## Applications

### Rail

For rail track maintenance is useful to monitor changes in parameters including cant, twist and slew that can warn engineers of incoming, potentially dangerous problems. It also improve long-term asset management by targeting maintenance on the most critical areas.
Devices like wireless titlmeters or total stations, can be installed to contro the geometry of the track.

### Construction

The control the integrity and stability of the construction site and the surrundings 3 party buildings and structures, discreet IOT sensors can be installed to provide assurance that activities such as excavation or piling are not causing any damage.
Construction-related applications of wireless monitoring are varied and include monitoring walls, excavations, foundations and cranes.

### Mining

Mines are continue earthworks that require precise monitoring for safety and productivity.
Slope monitoring and pore pressure dewatering control are a common application where inclinometers and piezometers are used. The automatization and managing of the data is key for streamline operations.
Tailing dam integrity can be monitored using a range of instruments at the surface and deployed in boreholes to measure movement and conditions such as water pressure that can provide early warning of instability.

### Infrastructure

The use of digital and remote monitoring of civil infrastructure improves safety and efficiency of the monitoring process for a wide range of civil structures, such as bridges.

The use of wireless technologies reduces the need for a physical presence at a location and saves time, money, and resources by eliminating unnecessary trips. Cloud platforms allow multiple secure access and continues updates for long-term monitoring civil infrastructure.

### Dams

Dams are critical infrastructures that support tremendous forces and that need to be long-term monitored since any failure may have tremendous consequences.
The intricate galleries of concrete dams are a challenge for traditional wireless but not any more, since the new long-range mesh technology is available. With Ackcio, monitoring dams galleries is possible wirelessly, thanks to the mesh topology.
